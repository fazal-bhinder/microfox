Kindly refer to the table below to further understand the status codes when indicating the success or failure of an API call.\n\nStatus Codes\tDescription\n400 (Bad Request)\tThis is due to an invalid request and the server could not process the user's request\n401 (Unauthorized)\tThis is due to the lack of valid authentication credentials for the requested resource by the user\n403 (Forbidden)\tThis is likely indicating that your access is blocked by our server, and we're unable to authorize your request\n429 (Too many requests)\tThis is likely indicating that the rate limit has reached. The user should reduce the number of calls made, or consider scaling their service plan that has much higher rate limits and call credits\n500 (Internal Server Error)\tThis is a generic error response indicating that the server has encountered an unexpected issue that prevented it from fulfilling the request\n503 (Service Unavailable)\tThe service is currently unavailable. Please check the API status and updates on https://status.coingecko.com\n1020 (Access Denied)\tThis is due to violation of CDN firewall rule\n10002 (Incorrect API Key)\tYou have provided incorrect API key credentials. Please check your keys in developer dashboard and ensure that your request is authorized\n10005\tYou may not have access to this endpoint. e.g. 'This request is limited Pro API subscribers'. You may wanna subscribe to a paid plan here\nCORS error\tA CORS error occurs when the server doesn‚Äôt return the CORS headers required. You may learn more and attempt the recommended solutions here\n\n\nRate Limit\nüìò\n\nNotes\n\nIf you're using the Public API with Google Sheet and got hit with error, this is due to the IP sharing among Google Sheet users, and we have no control over this. If you need reliable performance, please register for a demo account or subscribe to a paid plan that comes with dedicated infra (API key) to prevent rate limit issues.\nFor more details, please go to the page here.\nFor Public API user (Demo plan), the rate limit is ~30 calls per minutes and it varies depending on the traffic size.\nIf you're Pro API user (any paid plan), the rate limit is depending on the paid plan that you're subscribed to.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\nüì° Endpoint Overview\nüü¢ API Status\nDid this page help you?\nYes\nNo",
