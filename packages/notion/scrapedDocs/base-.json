Notion's REST API facilitates direct interactions with workspace elements through programming. Key functionalities include:\n\nPages: Create, update, and retrieve page content.\nDatabases: Manage database, properties, entries, and schemas.\nUsers: Access user profiles and permissions.\nComments: Handle page and inline comments.\nContent Queries: Search through workspace content.\nAuthentication: Secure integrations with OAuth 2.0.\nLink Previews: Customize how links appear when shared.\n\nTo make interactions within Notion workspaces programmatically, you must associate these actions with a Notion user. Notion facilitates this by allowing API requests to be linked to a \"bot\" user.\n\nDevelopers create integrations to define a bot's capabilities, including authenticating API requests, deciding when to make requests, and setting the bot's read/write permissions. Essentially, using Notion's Public API involves creating an integration that outlines how a bot interacts with your workspace and assigns REST API requests to the bot.\n\nThere are two primary integration types:\n\nInternal: For private workspace enhancements.\nPublic: For broader, shareable functionalities, including Link Previews.\n\nFor further details on integration possibilities and API specifics, proceed with the guide or consult the API reference. Check out our demos for practical examples.\n\nWhat is a Notion Integration?\n\nA Notion integration, sometimes referred as a connection, enables developers to programmatically interact with Notion workspaces. These integrations facilitate linking Notion workspace data with other applications or the automation of workflows within Notion.\n\nIntegrations are installed in Notion workspaces and require explicit permission from users to access Notion pages and databases.\n\nCreate Notion integrations that unlock new possibilities for teams.\n\nNotion users have access to a vast library of existing integrations to enrich their experience further. For developers interested in creating custom solutions, Notion supports the development of both internal and public integrations. Both utilize the Notion API for workspace interactions.\n\nLet's explore internal and public integrations.\n\nInternal vs. Public Integrations\n\nNotion integrations come in two types: Internal and Public. Understanding the differences between them helps in choosing the right approach for your development needs.\n\nInternal IntegrationsÂ are exclusive to a single workspace, accessible only to its members. They are ideal for custom workspace enhancements.\nPublic IntegrationsÂ are designed for a wider audience, usable across any Notion workspace. They cater to broad use cases and follow the OAuth 2.0 protocol for workspace access.\nðŸ”‘\n\nPublic integrations must undergo a Notion security review before publishing.\n\nKey Differences\nFeature\tInternal Integrations\tPublic Integrations\nScope\tConfined to a single, specific workspace.\tAvailable across multiple, unrelated workspaces.\nUser Access\tOnly accessible by members of the workspace where it's installed.\tAccessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.\nCreation\tCreated by Workspace Owners within the integration dashboard.\tCreated by Workspace Owners within the integration dashboard.\nPermissions\tWorkspace members explicitly grant access to their pages or databases via Notionâ€™s UI.\tUsers authorize access to their pages during the OAuth flow, or by sharing pages directly with the integration.\nOAuth Protocol\tNot applicable, as access is limited to a single workspace.\tUses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to securely access information across multiple workspaces.\nDashboard Visibility\tVisible to Workspace Owners in the integration dashboard, including integrations created by others.\t-\nWhat You Can Build: Integration Use Cases\n\nNotionâ€™s REST API opens up a world of possibilities for integrations, ranging from enhancing internal workflow to creating public-facing applications. Hereâ€™s a closer look at some of the innovative integrations developers have built with Notion:\n\nData Integrations\n\nData integrations leverage the Notion API to automate data flow between Notion and other systems.\n\nAutomated Notifications: Develop integrations that monitor Notion databases for changes. Upon detecting a change, these integrations can automatically send notifications various communication channels.\nGithub Synchronization: Create integrations that keep Notion issues in sync with GitHub issues.\nExternal Data Import: Build integrations that import data from external sources directly into Notion databases. This can include importing customer data, project updates, or any other relevant information.\nðŸ”—\n\nExamples:\n\nCreate an integration\nWorking with comments\nWorking with databases\nWorking with files and media\nWorking with page content\nLink Preview Integrations\n\nEnhance the sharing experience within Notion with Link preview integrations, offering a glimpse into the content of shared links:\n\nLink Preview of a GitHub PR.\n\nCreate integrations that allow for the customization of how shared links are presented in Notion, providing context and enhancing engagement.\n\nðŸ”‘\n\nLink Preview Integrations differ from public integrations. Review the Link Preview guide.\n\nðŸ›‘\n\nTo build a Link Preview integration, developers must first apply for access to the feature through the Notion Link Preview API request form.\n\nLink Preview integrations published for distribution require a review from Notion's platform and security teams.\n\nðŸ”—\n\nQuick Links\n\nIntroduction to Link Preview integrations\nBuild a Link Preview integration\nAPI reference docs for the Link Preview unfurl attribute object\nHelp Centre\nIdentity Management Integrations (Enterprise Plans ONLY)\n\nFor enterprise-level workspaces, Notion offers advanced identity management capabilities:\n\nSCIM API for User and Group Management: Utilize the SCIM API to automate the provisioning and management of users and groups within enterprise workspaces, streamlining administrative tasks.\nSAML SSO for Enhanced Security: Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML for a secure and convenient authentication process, simplifying access for users across the enterprise.\nðŸ”—\n\nQuick Links\n\nProvision users and groups with SCIM\nSAML SSO configuration\nStarting Your Integration Journey\n\nEmbarking on building an integration with Notion?
