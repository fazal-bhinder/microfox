## Notion API TypeScript SDK Summary

This summary outlines the information needed to generate a TypeScript SDK for the Notion API, based on the provided documentation.  The documentation primarily focuses on high-level concepts and integration types, rather than specific API endpoint details.  Therefore, this summary reflects that high-level view and points to the need for the full API reference for detailed SDK generation.

**Missing API Reference:** The provided documentation lacks concrete details about API endpoints, request/response structures, and specific parameters.  A robust SDK requires the official API reference (linked in the document as "API reference documentation") to be complete. This summary assumes the availability of that reference and outlines the *structure* of the SDK based on the general information available.

**1. API Endpoints and HTTP Methods:**

The documentation mentions functionalities that imply the existence of several API endpoints, but doesn't provide the actual endpoints.  The SDK will need to be built based on the official API reference.  Expected endpoint categories include:

* **Pages:**  `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` (for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting pages)
* **Databases:** `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` (for managing databases, properties, entries, and schemas)
* **Users:** `GET` (for accessing user profiles and permissions)
* **Comments:** `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` (for handling page and inline comments)
* **Search:** `POST` (for querying workspace content)
* **Link Previews (Unfurl):**  Specific endpoints and methods need to be determined from the API reference.  Likely `POST` for generating previews.
* **SCIM (Enterprise):** Endpoints for user and group management using SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management).  Details would be in the enterprise API documentation.


**2. Request Headers and Authentication:**

* **Authorization:** OAuth 2.0 is the primary authentication method for Public integrations. Internal integrations might use different mechanisms (API key or other token-based authentication). The SDK needs to handle both scenarios.
* **Content-Type:**  `application/json` is expected for most requests.


**3. Request Parameters and Types:**

The specific parameters and their types are not available in this overview.  The SDK generation will rely on the API reference.  Expected parameter types include:

* `string` (UUIDs, text, etc.)
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `object` (nested JSON structures for page content, database properties, etc.)
* `array`
* Enums (for specific properties or states)


**4. Response Formats and Data Structures:**

* **Format:** JSON is the expected response format.
* **Data Structures:** The specific data structures for pages, databases, users, comments, etc. are not defined in the overview.  The API reference is crucial for this information.  The SDK should use TypeScript interfaces to strongly type these responses.


**5. Authentication Methods and Required Credentials:**

* **OAuth 2.0 (Public Integrations):**  The SDK needs to implement the OAuth 2.0 flow, including obtaining access tokens and refresh tokens.  It should handle different grant types (authorization code, client credentials, etc.).
* **Internal Integrations:** The authentication method for internal integrations is not specified.  The SDK should support potential methods like API keys or other token-based authentication.
* **Credentials:**
    * **Client ID:** Required for OAuth 2.0 and potentially for internal integrations.
    * **Client Secret:** Required for OAuth 2.0.
    * **Redirect URI:** Required for OAuth 2.0.
    * **API Key (potentially for internal integrations):**


**6. Other Important Information:**

* **Rate Limiting:** The documentation doesn't mention rate limits. The SDK should handle rate limiting gracefully, potentially using retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.
* **Error Handling:**  The SDK should provide clear error messages based on the API responses.
* **TypeScript Interfaces:**  The SDK should define TypeScript interfaces for all request and response objects to ensure type safety.
* **SDK Structure:** The SDK could be organized by functional areas (pages, databases, users, etc.) or by resource types.
* **Notion SDK for JavaScript:** The documentation mentions an existing JavaScript SDK.  The TypeScript SDK could potentially build upon or leverage parts of this existing SDK.
* **Internal vs. Public Integration Handling:**  The SDK needs to clearly differentiate between internal and public integrations and provide separate authentication and authorization flows.
* **Link Preview API Access:**  The Link Preview API requires special access.  The SDK should document this requirement and potentially provide helper functions to request access.


**Example TypeScript Interface (Illustrative):**

```typescript
interface NotionPage {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  properties: { [key: string]: any }; // Placeholder - actual structure from API reference
  // ... other properties
}
```

This summary provides a framework for building a Notion TypeScript SDK.  The crucial next step is to obtain the complete API reference documentation and use it to fill in the missing details about endpoints, parameters, request/response structures, and authentication specifics.  This will enable the creation of a robust and type-safe SDK.
