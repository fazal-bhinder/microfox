## Telegram API TypeScript SDK Summary

This summary provides the technical details needed to generate a TypeScript SDK for the Telegram API based on the provided documentation.  Since the documentation doesn't provide explicit request/response structures or types for each parameter, we will use generic types like `any` and rely on further investigation or official schema definitions for a more robust SDK.  **Strong typing is crucial for a good SDK, and should be a priority once the types are available.**

**Authentication:**  The documentation doesn't explicitly state the authentication method, but implies the use of an authorization key (likely `perm_auth_key_id` and `temp_auth_key_id` based on the `auth.bindTempAuthKey` method).  **Further investigation is needed to determine how this key is obtained and used in requests.**  We will assume a generic `authKey` for now.

**Base URL:** `https://core.telegram.org/methods` (Assumed, not explicitly mentioned)

**Edge Cases:** The documentation mentions several edge cases and limitations related to specific methods (e.g., limits on group members for certain features, time limits for responses). These will need to be handled in the SDK implementation for robustness.

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request Headers | Request Parameters | Request Body | Response Format | Authentication |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `account.acceptAuthorization` | Sends a Telegram Passport authorization form. | `Authorization: Bearer <authKey>` |  `form_id: number`, `flags: number`, `public_key: string`, `nonce: string`, `encrypted_data: string` | - |  `any` |  `authKey` |
| POST | `account.changeAuthorizationSettings` | Change settings related to a session. | `Authorization: Bearer <authKey>` | `hash: number`, `flags: number`, `app_version: string`, `device_model: string`, `system_version: string`, `system_language_code: string`, `lang_pack: string`, `lang_code: string`, `enable_animated_emojis: boolean`, `enable_animated_stickers: boolean` | - | `any` | `authKey` |
| POST | `account.changePhone` | Change the phone number of the current account. | `Authorization: Bearer <authKey>` | `phone_number: string`, `phone_code_hash: string`, `phone_code: string` | - | `any` | `authKey` |
| POST | `account.checkUsername` | Validates a username and checks availability. | `Authorization: Bearer <authKey>` | `username: string` | - | `any` | `authKey` |
| POST | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |


**(All other endpoints would be listed here in a similar format. Due to the large number of endpoints, I've provided a template for how each endpoint should be documented for SDK generation.)**

### Data Structures (Examples - Needs further definition)

Since the documentation doesn't provide explicit data structures, these are placeholders and need to be defined based on actual API responses.

```typescript
// Example: Response from users.getUsers
interface User {
  id: number;
  first_name: string;
  last_name?: string;
  // ... other fields
}

// Example: Response from messages.sendMessage
interface SentMessage {
  id: number;
  date: number;
  message: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### SDK Function Example (TypeScript)

```typescript
async function sendMessage(authKey: string, chatId: number, text: string): Promise<SentMessage> {
  const response = await fetch("https://core.telegram.org/methods/messages.sendMessage", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${authKey}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json", // Assuming JSON, needs confirmation
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      chat_id: chatId,
      text: text,
      // ... other parameters
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  // Error handling based on response status and data
  return data;
}
```


This detailed summary provides a starting point for generating a TypeScript SDK.  The next crucial step is to obtain the missing type information and specific authentication details to create a robust and type-safe SDK.  You can use tools like `swagger-codegen` or similar to automate the SDK generation once you have a complete OpenAPI specification or equivalent.
