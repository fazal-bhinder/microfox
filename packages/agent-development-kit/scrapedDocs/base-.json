While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and is built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK was designed to make agent development feel more like software development, to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range from simple tasks to complex workflows.\n\nGet started:\npip install google-adk\n\nQuickstart Tutorials Sample Agents API Reference Contribute ❤️\n\nLearn more¶\n\n Flexible Orchestration\n\nDefine workflows using workflow agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop) for predictable pipelines, or leverage LLM-driven dynamic routing (LlmAgent transfer) for adaptive behavior.\n\nLearn about agents\n\n Multi-Agent Architecture\n\nBuild modular and scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents in a hierarchy. Enable complex coordination and delegation.\n\nExplore multi-agent systems\n\n Rich Tool Ecosystem\n\nEquip agents with diverse capabilities: use pre-built tools (Search, Code Exec), create custom functions, integrate 3rd-party libraries (LangChain, CrewAI), or even use other agents as tools.\n\nBrowse tools\n\n Deployment Ready\n\nContainerize and deploy your agents anywhere – run locally, scale with Vertex AI Agent Engine, or integrate into custom infrastructure using Cloud Run or Docker.\n\nDeploy agents\n\n Built-in Evaluation\n\nSystematically assess agent performance by evaluating both the final response quality and the step-by-step execution trajectory against predefined test cases.\n\nEvaluate agents\n\n Building Safe and Secure Agents\n\nLearn how to building powerful and trustworthy agents by implementing security and safety patterns and best practices into your agent's design.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is subject to the \"Pre-GA Offerings Terms\" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA features are available \"as is\" and might have limited support.
